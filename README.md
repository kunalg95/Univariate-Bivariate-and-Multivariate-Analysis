# Univariate-Bivariate-and-Multivariate-Analysis
Implementation

If you are analysing an Iris-dataset, you need to be able to classify each data-points as either setosa, virginica and versicolor. We can do that using 3 different types of analysis, depending on the type of data-set we are looking at.

1.Univariate- using 1 feature<br/>
2.Bivariate- using 2 features<br/>
3.Multivariate- using 3 or more features<br/>

Example- weight(x-axis),Height(y-axis) and output(setosa,virginica,versicolor).<br/>
This Analysis gives us idea whether we can apply any classification algorithm or we go for non-linear algorithm like(DT, RF, XGBoost). Also, one of the analysis tells about correlation between features using pairplot method inside seaborn library.
