# Univariate-Bivariate-and-Multivariate-Analysis
Implementation

Choose Iris-dataset which consist of features like sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length and petal_width based on these need to classify each data-points as 
either setosa, virginica and versicolor.We can do that using 3 types of analysis:

1.Univariate- using 1 feature
2.Bivariate- using 2 features
3.Multivariate- using 3 or more features

This Analysis give us idea whether we can apply any classification algorithm or we go for non-linear algorithm like(DT, RF, XGBoost). Also, one of the analysis
called multivariate tells about correlation between features using pairplot method inside seaborn library.
